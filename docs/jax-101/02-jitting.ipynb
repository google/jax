    "The [Understanding Jaxprs](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jaxpr.html) section of the documentation provides more information on the meaning of the above output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, note how the jaxpr does not capture the side-effect of the function: there is nothing in it corresponding to `global_list.append(x)`. This is a feature, not a bug: JAX is designed to understand side-effect-free (a.k.a. functionally pure) code. If *pure function* and *side-effect* are unfamiliar terms, this is explained in a little more detail in [ðŸ”ª JAX - The Sharp Bits ðŸ”ª: Pure Functions](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/Common_Gotchas_in_JAX.html#pure-functions).\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, impure functions can still be written and even run, but JAX gives no guarantees about their behaviour once converted to jaxpr. However, as a rule of thumb, you can expect (but shouldn't rely on) the side-effects of a JAX-transformed function to run once (during the first call), and never again. This is because of the way that JAX generates jaxpr, using a process called 'tracing'.\n",
    "\n",
    "When tracing, JAX wraps each argument by a *tracer* object. These tracers then record all JAX operations performed on them during the function call (which happens in regular Python). Then, JAX uses the tracer records to reconstruct the entire function. The output of that reconstruction is the jaxpr. Since the tracers do not record the Python side-effects, they do not appear in the jaxpr. However, the side-effects still happen during the trace itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: the Python `print()` function is not pure: the text output is a side-effect of the function. Therefore, any `print()` calls will only happen during tracing, and will not appear in the jaxpr:"

    "The problem is that we tried to condition on the *value* of an input to the function being jitted. The reason we can't do this is related to the fact mentioned above that jaxpr depends on the actual values used to trace it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more specific information about the values we use in the trace, the more we can use standard Python control flow to express ourselves. However, being too specific means we can't reuse the same traced function for other values. JAX solves this by tracing at different levels of abstraction for different purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For `jax.jit`, the default level is `ShapedArray` -- that is, each tracer has a concrete shape (which we're allowed to condition on), but no concrete value. This allows the compiled function to work on all possible inputs with the same shape -- the standard use case in machine learning. However, because the tracers have no concrete value, if we attempt to condition on one, we get the error above.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `jax.grad`, the constraints are more relaxed, so you can do more. If you compose several transformations, however, you must satisfy the constraints of the most strict one. So, if you `jit(grad(f))`, `f` mustn't condition on value. For more detail on the interaction between Python control flow and JAX, see [ðŸ”ª JAX - The Sharp Bits ðŸ”ª: Control Flow](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/Common_Gotchas_in_JAX.html#control-flow).\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to deal with this problem is to rewrite the code to avoid conditionals on value. Another is to use special [control flow operators](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.lax.html#control-flow-operators) like `jax.lax.cond`. However, sometimes that is impossible. In that case, you can consider jitting only part of the function. For example, if the most computationally expensive part of the function is inside the loop, we can JIT just that inner part (though make sure to check the next section on caching to avoid shooting yourself in the foot):"
