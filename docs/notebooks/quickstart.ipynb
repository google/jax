        "# JAX Quickstart\n",
        "\n",
        "**JAX is NumPy on the CPU, GPU, and TPU, with great automatic differentiation for high-performance general numerical computing and machine learning research.**\n",
        "\n",
        "It is an extensible system for composable function transformations using Python and NumPy. JAX is fast, easy to use, and uses a functional programming model, which aligns well with mathematics.\n",
        "\n",
        "With an updated version of **[Autograd](https://github.com/hips/autograd)**, JAX\n",
        "can automatically differentiate native Python and NumPy code. It can\n",
        "differentiate through a large subset of Python’s features, including loops, if statements, recursions, and closures. \n",
        "\n",
        "JAX can even **take derivatives of derivatives of\n",
        "derivatives**. It supports **reverse-mode and forward-mode differentiation** and the two can be composed arbitrarily to any order.\n",
        "\n",
        "What’s new is that JAX uses\n",
        "**[XLA](https://www.tensorflow.org/xla)** to compile and run your NumPy code on accelerators, like GPUs and TPUs. Compilation happens under the hood by default, with library calls getting just-in-time compiled and executed. But JAX even lets you **just-in-time (JIT) compile** your own Python functions into XLA-optimized kernels using a one-function API. Since all computations are compiled with JIT, there are almost no handwritten kernels. And JIT gives you an almost \"eager-mode\" performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Compilation and automatic differentiation (autodiff) can be composed arbitrarily, so you\n",
        "can express sophisticated algorithms and get maximal performance without having to leave Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "JAX is much more than just an accelerator-backed NumPy. It comes with a few key _program transformations_ (transforms) that are useful when writing numerical code. \n",
        "\n",
        "In this quickstart, you'll be focusing on the following transforms:\n",
        "\n",
        " - [jit()](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.html#jax.jit): for speeding up your code\n",
        " - [grad()](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.html#jax.grad): for taking derivatives\n",
        " - [vmap()](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.html#vectorization-vmap): for automatic vectorization or batching\n",
        " - [pmap()](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.html#parallelization-pmap): for executing functions on multiple accelerators in parallel (on multiple GPU or even TPU cores)\n",
        "\n",
        "The general API is Pythonic and user-friendly—you pass a function into a transform and get a function out. You'll see it in the examples below.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since JAX is still being developed, do check out the [Common Gotchas in JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/Common_Gotchas_in_JAX.html) notebook."
