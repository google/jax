# This workflow adds the community approval label ("lgtm") to pull requests. It
# does *not* indicate maintainer approval. This a way to visually highlight that
# someone in the world thinks the pull request is ready for further review. This
# event is triggered by a pull request approval, or simply a comment that
# contains the text "lgtm".
